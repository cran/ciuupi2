# ciuupi2

The goal of ciuupi2 is to compute the Kabaila and Giri (2009) confidence
interval that utilizes the uncertain prior information in linear
regression with unknown error variance. These confidence intervals have
desirable coverage and expected length properties.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ciuupi2 from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ciuupi2")
```
